##Description

Challenge was to create a new developer profile page using react.

A few challeneges I had for this assignment was understanding the react-router-dom feature. The issue was I couldnt get the my pages to link to the nav bar and then navigate to the corresponding page. It seemed like a large challenge compared to the quick and normal way I would achieve that in regular css. After refering to previous activities in the react module, I was able to get it worked out.

skills implemented: React, css
